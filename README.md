## Known issues / Limitations

- If any custom plugin is used, dark/light theme switch, base theme will not work for those custom plugins. Refer [this](https://github.com/yesoreyeram/yesoreyeram-boomtheme-panel/issues/3) github issue

- Theme panel should be within view port. Otherwise, Grafana won't render the theme. Refer [this](https://github.com/yesoreyeram/yesoreyeram-boomtheme-panel/issues/17)
